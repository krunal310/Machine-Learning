# Machine-Learning
## Machine Learning assignments and lab experiments

This repository contains implementaion and document containing problem description, step by step procedure and final results of basic Machine Learning algorithms. One common dataset of House Price is used to maintain consistency and get better understanding. Implementation of these experiments is carried of in Google Colaboratory.

The intention of this repository is to give basic understanding and working of Machine Learning model.
